# Play Next
Play Next in YouTube - Chrome Extension

Have you ever felt lazy? Not talking about extremity but I don't like changing songs one after other when they finish playing. I repeat I don't like opening a new tab and then searching for a song after which I play it **only when** the current song ends playing.
<br/>This chrome extension is a dark knight for people like us. Now you can add songs from whichever tab you want even when the current song is playing and like an obedient **queue** it will play each song one after other.

Well words are deceiveing, lets see the extension in action:


# Installation

1. Download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/nishnik/play_next/archive/master.zip).
2. Extract it.
3. Type `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome/Chromium browser.
4. Tick the Developer mode and then click `Load unpacked extension`.
5. Select the directory where you had extracted the zip file. Done!

This is still in developmental phase. Feel free to contribute.
